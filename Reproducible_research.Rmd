# What is ideal reproducible research?

- Transparent methods
- Accessible data and code
- Can be replicated
- Interoperable across operating systems and contexts

Historically, science was secretive but there has been a recent push to make science more open.

Many aspects of science can be made transparent, open, replicable. This course is about computation reproducibility.

Goal as an open scientist: Be able to reproduce the results at a later time, better if collaborator can do so, someone from research community.

There are processes to handle sensitive data (keep the science part open but the sensitive parts, private)

# Organisation

# Data curation and storage

# R / Rmd / Qmd

### .R 
Traditional we have written our R code in `.R` files. These are great, especially for simple analyses or for storing functions (more on these tomorrow!). In `.R` files, we would write our comments using  the hash tag e.g. `# This is a comment`. Lines with `#` at the start will be treated as comments and R won't read those lines as code. Comments are handy when we want to give ourselves/reader a little reminder what is happening at each line but if you want to elaborate or talk about the maths/stats, comments are a bit clunky!

### .Rmd
In situations where you want to elaborate alongside your code, `.Rmd` (RMarkdown) is a great option! `.Rmd` allows you to embed R code/figures/hyperlinks/tables with regular plain text. Don't worry you can still use comments. Within an `.Rmd`, your R code will live in a code chunk (grey boxes). The great thing about `.Rmd` is that you can knit/render the file into a beautiful output (`.html`/`.docx`/`.pdf`). Check out this [intro](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html).

[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) allows you to create really beautiful reports, you can even make slides as well. A lot of the fine tuning comes to the header of the `.Rmd`. For example, you can add an author field.

Some code will print extra messages e.g `library(tidyverse)`. You can control the behaviour of the output your R chunks `r, message=FALSE}`. Setting `message=FALSE` will turn off the messages that come from your R code. Learn more about the chunk options [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html) 

### .Qmd

Quarto documents (`.Qmd`), is a new age document file type. It is built from `.Rmd`. If you know how to use `.Rmd`, you will know how to use a `.Qmd`. The biggest different is that `.Qmd` allows for cross-language collaborations.  Python and R users can contribute to the same document. 

There is an interactive editor but this is a little buggy

You will need to [download Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) in order to use Quarto docs. 

Quarto is really powerful, it allows you to build books, websites, blogs as well as beautiful rendered reports.
