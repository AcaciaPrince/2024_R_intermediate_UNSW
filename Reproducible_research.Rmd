# What is ideal reproducible research?

- Transparent methods
- Accessible data and code
- Can be replicated
- Interoperable across operating systems and contexts

Historically, science was secretive but there has been a recent push to make science more open.

Many aspects of science can be made transparent, open, replicable. This course is about computation reproducibility.

Goal as an open scientist: Be able to reproduce the results at a later time, better if collaborator can do so, someone from research community.

There are processes to handle sensitive data (keep the science part open but the sensitive parts, private)

## Activity: Identify challenges/problems/barriers for reproducible analyses and collaboration
