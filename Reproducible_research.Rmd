# What is ideal reproducible research?

- Transparent methods
- Accessible data and code
- Can be replicated
- Interoperable across operating systems and contexts

Historically, science was secretive but there has been a recent push to make science more open.

Many aspects of science can be made transparent, open, replicable. This course is about computation reproducibility.

Goal as an open scientist: Be able to reproduce the results at a later time, better if collaborator can do so, someone from research community.

There are processes to handle sensitive data (keep the science part open but the sensitive parts, private)

## Activity: Identify challenges/problems/barriers for reproducible analyses and collaboration

(see detailed notes in attached file)

- Software environment
- Workflow
- Coding conventions
- Versions
- Documentation
- Data management
- Big data

# Organisation

Projects

- a project is a sensible unit of organisation for your work. Usually this is a paper, PhD chapter, or report
- everything you need for your project is in this folder
- each project should be an separate github repository
- Add an Rstudio project file to the project, and use this to open Rstduio in the right folder

Have predictable folder structure within your projects

- ideally align with community practices. 
- a common folder structure is something like this
```
my_porject
├── my_porject.Rproj      # Rstudio project file
├── README.md             # a text file with high level summary of the project
├── analysis.Rmd          # main file running your analysis
├── data                  # raw data files & metadata
├── downloads             # data files that are downloaded
├── docs                  # any documents you're stroing
├── ignore                # a folder to dump stuff in that is ignored by git
├── R                     # folder with custom R functions
├── outputs               # folder for figures or files genearted by your code
└── scripts               # R scripts 
```

Within the project, use relative paths in your code

- Avoid absolute pathnames, as these break when the folder is moved within your computer or to your collaborators computer

```{r}
# Yes!!!! do this
penguin_sizes <- read.csv("data/penguin_sizes.csv")

# No!!!! Avoid  this
penguin_sizes <- read.csv("/Users/dfalster/GitHub/projects/2024_R_intermediate_UNSW/data/penguin_sizes.csv")
```

Include an obvious landing point in your code. 

- i usually add a file called `Analysis.Rmd` in the project root, as an obvious point to go
- extra details can go in the folder called `README.md`
